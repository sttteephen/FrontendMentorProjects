## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned the purpose of the css box-sizing attribute and how to use it to fix the problem I was having with my input boxes being too wide when adding padding to them.

```css
input {
  box-sizing: border-box
}
```
This css snippet makes input elements take into account the amount of padding and border when calculating its width and height.
